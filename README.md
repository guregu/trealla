# Trealla Prolog

This is a fork of [Trealla Prolog](https://github.com/trealla-prolog/trealla) for experimenting with WebAssembly/WASI.
For more info on Trealla, check out the parent repository.

We endeavor to keep this fork as close as possible to the upstream and contribute all stable changes upstream.
Ideally, when Wasm support is better stablized, this fork won't need to exist.

## Download

You can find binaries on [the Releases page](https://github.com/guregu/trealla/releases).

## Binaries on WAPM
~~You can grab Wasm binary builds from [guregu/trealla on WAPM](https://wapm.io/guregu/trealla).~~
~~These builds are uploaded automatically for each release.~~

**Note**: currently WAPM builds are [temporarily disabled](https://github.com/guregu/trealla/issues/11).

## Differences from upstream
- `library(wasm)` JSON-based programmatic toplevel.
- `library(wasm_*)` host-guest interop.
- `library(pseudojson)` Very fast JSON parser/generator (but not validator).
- Wasm system predicates: `'$host_call'/2` and `'$host_resume'/1` (see `js_eval/2` in `library/wasm_js.pl`).

## Compile targets

There's a bunch of new compile targets for Wasm.

### wasm

`make wasm` will build a pure WASI version of Trealla: `tpl.wasm`. This binary can be executed by any runtime that supports WASI. (Mostly) upstreamed.

### libtpl

`make libtpl` will build a Wasm binary with host calls enabled: `libtpl.wasm`. This adds host-guest interop exports and imports that break pure WASI compatibility. This is currently used by the Go port.

### libtpl-js

`make libtpl-js` builds the trealla-js version of libtpl. Includes [JS-specific predicates](https://github.com/guregu/trealla-js#predicate-reference).

### libtpl-spin

You can use Trealla Prolog with [Spin](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/index), a server-side
runtime for WebAssembly.

`make libtpl-spin` builds the [Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin)-flavored libtpl.

`make SPINDIR=path/to/spin/source wit` to generate the Wasm component code via wit-bindgen.
These files are included in the repository so you won't need to generate them unless adding support for a new one.
Currently requires wit-bindgen v0.2.0.

#### Spin Components

ðŸ‘‰ For a helpful template and README to get started, check out [**trealla-spin**](https://github.com/guregu/trealla-spin). See also `library/spin.pl`.

- [x] Inbound HTTP (via `http_handler/4` multifile predicate)
- [x] Outbound HTTP (via `http_fetch/3`)
- [ ] Outbound PostgreSQL
- [ ] Inbound Redis
- [ ] Outbound Redis
- [x] [Key-value store](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/kv-store)

Place a file called `init.pl` or `lib.pl` in your root directory of the Spin component.
From there you can load other modules, etc.

Example of a visit counter using Spin:

```prolog
:- use_module(library(spin)).

% Roughly:
% http_handler(verb(Path, QueryParams), Headers, RequestBody, ResponseCode) :-
%	http_header_set("cache-control", "no-cache"),
%   write(http_body, 'response body').

http_handler(get("/", _), _, _, 200) :-
	html_content,
	setup_call_cleanup(
		store_open(default, Store),
		(
			(  store_get(Store, counter, N0)
			-> true
			;  N0 = 0
			),
			succ(N0, N),
			store_set(Store, counter, N)
		),
		store_close(Store)
	),
	format(http_body, "Welcome, visitor #~d!", [N]).
```
